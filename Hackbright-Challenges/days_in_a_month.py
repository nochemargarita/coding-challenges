"""How many days are there in a month?

Given a string with a month and a year (separated by a space),
returns the number of days in that month.

For example::

    >>> for i in range(1, 13):
    ...     date = str(i) + " 2016"
    ...     print("%s has %s days." % (date, days_in_month(date)))
    1 2016 has 31 days.
    2 2016 has 29 days.
    3 2016 has 31 days.
    4 2016 has 30 days.
    5 2016 has 31 days.
    6 2016 has 30 days.
    7 2016 has 31 days.
    8 2016 has 31 days.
    9 2016 has 30 days.
    10 2016 has 31 days.
    11 2016 has 30 days.
    12 2016 has 31 days.

    >>> days_in_month("02 2015")
    28
